# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
1. I am really happy with my decision to change careers to programming. I really enjoyed these projects and solving problems. I am excited to have time to study before mod 1, but also cannot wait for it to start. 
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
1. My workflow is going well at this slow pace. I get a chance to read the projects and sleep on the solution. I do need to think about how I am going to be successful without the down time. 
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
1. I learned that I am capable of programming and if I use the correct terminology the internet is very helpful. I also reenforced that to eat an elephant you have to do it one bite at a time. 
1. On a more techinical side I learned about '+=', class, default arguments, instance methonds, and much more.
